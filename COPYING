Some points clarified


EUPL makes no obstacle for linking webAppOS code with another software component
that could be proprietary. There is no kind of “viral effect” resulting from the EUPL licence,
in so far linking is done for interoperability [https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/eupl-and-proprietary-commer].
Thus, apps, services, modules, and engines designed for webAppOS and using webAppOS
APIs, can be proprietary and distributed by your own terms.


If substantial portions of third-party code were obtained under another compatible
copyleft license (e.g. GPL) making the reuse of this copyleft licence mandatory for
distributing that code, EUPL provides exceptions to the obligation to license derivatives
of webAppOS under the EUPL in favor to that compatible license.
