document: Web Calls Service API

group: Introduction

The Web Calls Service is used by webAppOS and some apps
to invoke web calls.

Static calls (requiring no MRAM slot) are usually executed
right away, without enqueing them into Web Caller. Non-static (MRAM) calls and
calls requiring specific web processor are enqueued.

group: Access URL

The Web Calls Service is accessible via the following URL:
---code---
POST http[s]://[domain_or_ip]/services/webcalls/[action-name]
POST http[s]://[domain_or_ip]/services/webcalls/[action-name]?login=[login]&ws_token=[ws_token]
POST http[s]://[domain_or_ip]/services/webcalls/[action-name]?login=[login]&ws_token=[ws_token]&project_id=[project_id]
Content-Type: application/json
----------
Data must be sent as POST data encoded in UTF-8.

group: Authentication

Public webcalls actions do not require
authentication. 

Non-public calls require the "login" and "ws_token" arguments in the query string.

Non-static calls require also the "project_id" argument.

Example:

---code---
POST https://example.org/services/webcalls/someAction?login=user1&ws_token=123456&project_id=user1/myproject.owlgred
----------
