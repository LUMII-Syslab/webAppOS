document: Web Calls Service API

group: Introduction

The Web Calls Service is used by webAppOS and some apps
to make <web calls>.

Static calls (requiring no MRAM connection) are usually executed in the underlying servlet
right away, without using a server-side web processor. Non-static (MRAM) calls and
calls requiring specific web processor are enqueued.

group: Access URL

The Web Calls Service is accessible via the following URL:
---code---
POST http://<domain_or_ip>/services/webcalls/<action>
Content-Type: application/json
----------
Data must be sent as POST data encoded in UTF-8.

group: Authentication

Public webcalls actions do not require
authentication. 

Non-public calls require the "login" and "ws_token" arguments in the query string.

Non-static calls require also the "project_id" argument.

Example:

---code---
POST http://<domain_or_ip>/services/webcalls/someAction?login=user1&ws_token=123456&project_id=user1/myproject.owlgred
----------
