document: FileBrowser App Embedded API

group: Introduction

The FileBrowser app is a fully-fledged webAppOS app for browsing user's home directory.

When launched from index.html without the query string, the browser was as ordinary file explorer
However, when the query string contains the "embedded=true" argument, FileBrowser will
switch to the embedded mode. In this mode, FileBrowser assumes it is running inside an iframe, thus:
* it will not display the menu,
* it will try to inform the parent frame about certain events (see below).
                                                                                         
Usually, there is no need for developers to use embedded mode. Developers can rely on
function <webappos.desktop.browse_for_file> (from webappos.js) or on the underlying FileDialog app
(see <FileDialog API>).

The FileBrowser embedded mode is used by webAppOS FileDialog app, which adds the "Open" and "Cancel"
buttons as well as a file name field and a combobox for choosing a file mask.
