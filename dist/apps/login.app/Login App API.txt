document: Login App API

group: Introduction

The "login" app responsible for registering and authenticating users as well as for
password recovery.
End users interact with the login app, but the app itself relies on the "login" service (see <Login Service API>).

If the user has been already authenticated with the same browser,
the login app will try to validate existing credentials automatically.

On successful login, redirects to the default desktop app or to the provided redirect URL
(see below).

group: Access URL

The login app is accessible via one the following URLs:
---code---
https://[domain_or_ip]/apps/login
https://[domain_or_ip]/apps/login/?redirect=[redirect URL]
https://[domain_or_ip]/apps/login/?signout=true
----------

There can be two optional parameters:

* redirect - a redirect URL on successful login (the URL can contain symbols ":", "?", "&", etc.);
             if not specified, the underlying login service will redirect to the default Desktop app
* signout - can be set to true to instruct the login app to call
            <webappos.sign_out>, thus, avoiding automatic logging in.

It is strongly recommended to access the login app via the HTTPS connection.
