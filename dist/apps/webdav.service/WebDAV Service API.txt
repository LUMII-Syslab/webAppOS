document: WebDAV Service API

group: Introduction

The WebDAV service implements WebDAV protocol to access
user's home folder at webAppOS server (including mounted remote folders).

group: Access URL

The WebDAV service is accessible via the following URLs:
---code---
https[or http]://[domain_or_ip]/services/webdav/relative/path
https[or http]://webdav_service.[domain]/relative/path
----------


group: Authentication

All requests must provide valid user credentials. Use "Basic" autorization with Base64 encoding:
---code---
Authorization: Basic [login:password in Base64 encoding]
----------

Since the password is not encrypted, it is strongly adviced to use the
WebDAV service via the HTTPS connection.

group: Mounting from GNU/Linux

First, install davfs2:
---code---
sudo apt install davfs2
----------

Then mount using:
---code---
mkdir /mnt/mount-point
mount -t davfs -o noexec [your-WebDAV-service-URL-with-path] /mnt/mount-point 
----------
