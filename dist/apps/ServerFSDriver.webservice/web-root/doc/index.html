The webAppOS ServerFSDriver web service allows to mount some server-side directory
as a subdirectory in users' home directories. This may be useful when some server-side
directory contains resources (e.g., icons) that can be shared between many users.
<p>
You should list your server-side directory in the webAppOS registry key "apps/ServerFSDriver.webservice/allowed_dirs".

<p>
The driver prefix to be used is "serverfs". If you wish to mount the desired server-side directory
in the read-only mode, use the double-prefix "serverfs:readonly", e.g., "serverfs:readonly:/my/server-side/path".
<p>
To find out more about how file system drivers work and how file systems are mounted in the registry,
